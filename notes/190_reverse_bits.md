## Data Structures

* **`result`** - Stores the final answer/output of the algorithm

## Overall Approach

The problem asks us to reverse the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer.

This solution uses an efficient approach to solve the problem.

The algorithm works by:

1. **Step 1**
   
   ```python
   def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        result = 0
   ```
2. **Step 2**
   
   ```python
   for _ in range(32):
            result = (result << 1)
            result |= n & 1
            n = (n >> 1)
   ```

## Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: O(n)
* **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## Key Insights
