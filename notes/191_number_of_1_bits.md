## Data Structures

* **`result`** - Stores the final answer/output of the algorithm

## Overall Approach

The problem asks us to count the number of 1 bits in an unsigned integer.

This solution uses an efficient approach to solve the problem.

The algorithm works by:

1. **Step 1**
   
   ```python
   POP_COUNT = [bin(i).count('1') for i in range(2**8)] # every 8 bit number

    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        '''
   ```
2. **Step 2**
   
   ```python
   def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        '''
        result = 0
   ```

## Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: O(n)
* **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## Key Insights

* Consider edge cases and boundary conditions
* The algorithm handles the problem constraints efficiently

## Source Code Analysis

```python
class Solution:
    POP_COUNT = [bin(i).count('1') for i in range(2**8)] # every 8 bit number

    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        '''
        result = 0

        while n:
            result += (n & 1)
            n >>= 1

        return result
        '''

        return self.POP_COUNT[n & 0xFF] +  self.POP_COUNT[(n >> 8) & 0xFF] + self.POP_COUNT[(n >> 16) & 0xFF] + self.POP_COUNT[(n >> 24) & 0xFF]
