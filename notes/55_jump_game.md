## Data Structures

* **Key variables and data structures used in the solution**

## Overall Approach

The problem asks us to determine if you can reach the last index.

This solution uses an efficient approach to solve the problem.

The algorithm works by:

1. **Step 1**
   
   ```python
   def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        furthest = 0
   ```
2. **Step 2**
   
   ```python
   for i, step in enumerate(nums):
            if i > furthest:
                return False
   ```

## Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: O(n)
* **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## Key Insights

* Consider edge cases and boundary conditions
* The algorithm handles the problem constraints efficiently

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        furthest = 0

        for i, step in enumerate(nums):
            if i > furthest:
                return False

            if furthest <  i + step:
               furthest = i + step

            if furthest >= n - 1:
                return True

        return furthest >= n - 1
```
